#  Computer Project #7
#
# Algorithm
#  program that allows the user to play Nine Menâ€™s Morris according to the
#  rules outlined above the game continues until a players piece is less than 3 or
#  when the quit command is not entered. when a mill is formed, a piece is removed from the game and will never be
#  played again. In phase 1, the game runs and each player alternates to place their 9 pieces
#  after phase 2 begin, where each player moves their pieces placed until a winner is formed or q command entered.

    The game is played on a grid where each intersection is a "point" and
    three points in a row is called a "mill". Each player has 9 pieces and
    in Phase 1 the players take turns placing their pieces on the board to 
    make mills. When a mill (or mills) is made one opponent's piece can be 
    removed from play. In Phase 2 play continues by moving pieces to 
    adjacent points. 
    The game is ends when a player (the loser) has less than three 
    pieces on the board.
